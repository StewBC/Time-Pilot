# Time Pilot for Commander X16 using llvm-mos to compile the "C" version  
I will update this with more info in time.  For now, if you install llvm-mos you should be able to build this without issue.  In the misc folder is a python file.  I used that to convert the sprites, font and X16 launch image to VRAM ready images (tpfont.vrm and tpspr.vrm for the game).
  
Thank you
