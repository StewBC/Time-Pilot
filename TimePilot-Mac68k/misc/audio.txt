# This file describes the audio files and how they are to be converted
# for usei in Time Pilot on the 68K Mac

# The format is Name [loops]:[Hz]:[chanels]:[resID]
# defaults are loops 0, Hz 22050, chanels 2 (stereo vs 1 = mono), resID 128
# looping sounds are set to loop the entire sound - but this isn't implemented in my game code
# using a resID sets the counter to that value, and all subsequent files will count from that ID
